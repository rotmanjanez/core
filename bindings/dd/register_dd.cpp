This function classically simulates the quantum computation and repeatedly samples from the output distribution.
It supports mid-circuit measurements, resets, and classical control.

Args:
    qc: The quantum computation.
    shots: The number of samples to take.
        If the quantum computation contains no mid-circuit measurements or resets, the circuit is simulated once and the samples are drawn from the final state.
        Otherwise, the circuit is simulated once for each sample.
        Defaults to 1024.
    seed: The seed for the random number generator.
        If set to a specific non-zero value, the simulation is deterministic.
        If set to 0, the RNG is randomly seeded.
        Defaults to 0.

Returns:
    A histogram of the samples.
    Each sample is a bitstring representing the measurement outcomes of the qubits in the quantum computation.
    The leftmost bit corresponds to the most significant qubit, that is, the qubit with the highest index (big-endian).
    If the circuit contains measurements, only the qubits that are actively measured are included in the output distribution.
    Otherwise, all qubits in the circuit are measured.)pb");

This function classically simulates the quantum computation and returns the state vector of the final state.
It does not support measurements, resets, or classical control.

Since the state vector is guaranteed to be exponentially large in the number of qubits, this function is only suitable for small quantum computations.
Consider using the :func:`~mqt.core.dd.simulate` or the :func:`~mqt.core.dd.sample` functions, which never explicitly construct the state vector, for larger quantum computations.

Notes:
    This function internally constructs a :class:`~mqt.core.dd.DDPackage`, creates the zero state, and simulates the quantum computation via the :func:`simulate` function.
    The state vector is then extracted from the resulting DD via the :meth:`~mqt.core.dd.VectorDD.get_vector` method.

Since the unitary matrix is guaranteed to be exponentially large in the number of qubits, this function is only suitable for small quantum computations.

Notes:
    This function internally constructs a :class:`~mqt.core.dd.DDPackage`, creates the identity matrix, and builds the unitary matrix via the :func:`~mqt.core.dd.build_functionality` function.

This function classically simulates a quantum computation for a given initial state and returns the final state (represented as a DD).
Compared to the `sample` function, this function does not support measurements, resets, or classical control.
It only supports unitary operations.

The simulation is effectively computed by sequentially applying the operations of the quantum computation to the initial state.

Args:
    qc: The quantum computation. Must only contain unitary operations.
    initial_state: The initial state as a DD. Must have the same number of qubits as the quantum computation.
        The reference count of the initial state is decremented during the simulation, so the caller must ensure that the initial state has a non-zero reference count.
    dd_package: The DD package. Must be configured with a sufficient number of qubits to accommodate the quantum computation.

Returns:
    The final state as a DD. The reference count of the final state is non-zero and must be manually decremented by the caller if it is no longer needed.)pb");
