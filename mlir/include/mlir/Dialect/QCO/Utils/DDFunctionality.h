/**
 * @brief Sequentially build a matrix DD for a static unitary QCO `func.func`.
 *
 * @details Walks the entry block of @p func, maps `qco.static` SSA values to
 * wire indices (or, if none are present, qubit-typed function arguments as
 * wires `0..n-1`), assigns entry-block `qco.alloc` operations subsequent
 * wires, and applies unitary operations via decision-diagram multiplication.
 *
 * Supported programs:
 * - Standard single-, two-, and three-qubit gates with constant or bound
 *   parameters (sparse DD path)
 * - `ctrl` with a sole standard-gate body (same sparse path)
 * - Other `UnitaryOpInterface` ops with a compile-time known matrix (`inv`,
 *   compound `ctrl`, ...), including `gphase` and `barrier`
 * - QTensor bookkeeping over existing input wires
 * - Concrete QCO and SCF control flow and non-recursive single-block calls
 * - Concrete integer, index, and `f64` arithmetic and one-dimensional memrefs
 *   of those scalar types
 * - `qco.static` establishes the wire map (or qubit-typed `func` args if none),
 *   followed by entry-block `qco.alloc`; `sink` is ignored; returned qubits
 *   and qtensors must preserve canonical wire order
 *
 * Known one-, two-, and three-qubit matrices are constructed directly as DD
 * gates. Larger compile-time unitaries are embedded directly into a DD over
 * their target wires, so idle register qubits do not enlarge the local matrix.
 * Measurements, resets, unbound parameters, and non-concrete control flow are
 * not supported.
 *
 * @pre The containing module has passed MLIR verification and
 * `qco::verifyLinearity`.
 *
 * @param func The QCO function to construct the functionality for
 * @param dd The DD package to use (must hold at least the function's qubits)
 * @param bindings Concrete values for symbolic function arguments
 * @return The matrix DD on success, or failure for unsupported programs
