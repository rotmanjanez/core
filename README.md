# MQT Core - The Backbone of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

MQT Core is an open-source C++20 and Python library for quantum computing that
forms the backbone of the quantum software tools developed as part of the
[_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- Fully fledged intermediate representation (IR) for quantum computations.
- A state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) package for quantum computing.
- A QIR runtime based on the decision diagram package.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a
[discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core/discussions) or an
[issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core/issues) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core).

## Contributors and Supporters

MQT Core is developed by the
[Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and [MQSC](https://mq.sc).
Among others, it is part of the
[Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss)
ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the
[Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

The MQT will remain free, open-source, and permissively licensed — now and in
the future. We are firmly committed to keeping it open and actively maintained
for the quantum computing community.

To support this endeavor, please consider:

- Starring and sharing our repositories:
  <https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit>
- Contributing code, documentation, tests, or examples via issues and pull
  requests
- Citing the MQT in your publications (see [Cite This](#cite-this))
- Citing our research in your publications (see
  [References](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core/en/stable/references.html))
- Using the MQT in research and teaching, and sharing feedback and use cases
- Sponsoring us on GitHub: <https://github.com/sponsors/munich-quantum-toolkit>

## Getting Started

`mqt.core` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core/).

```console
uv pip install mqt.core
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt.core.ir import QuantumComputation

qc = QuantumComputation(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure(range(2), range(2))

print(qc)
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at
[ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core).**

## System Requirements

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake
3.24 or newer. For details on how to build the project, please refer to the
[documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core). Building (and
running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the
[latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT Core is compatible with all
[officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

The project relies on some external dependencies:

- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json):
  A JSON library for modern C++.
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest):
  A testing framework for C++ (only used in tests).

CMake will automatically look for installed versions of these libraries. If it
does not find them, they will be fetched automatically at configure time via the
[FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)
module (check out the documentation for more information on how to customize
this behavior).

It is recommended (although not required) to have
[GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) installed for visualization purposes.
