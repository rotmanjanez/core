# QIR Support in the MQT

The [_Quantum Intermediate Representation_ (QIR)](https://www.qir-alliance.org)
is a standardized intermediate representation for quantum programs based on the
[_LLVM intermediate representation_ (LLVM IR)](http://llvm.org/).

## The QIR Runtime in MQT Core

MQT Core provides a runtime for QIR that is based on its decision diagram-based
quantum simulator. This allows for the execution of QIR programs using MQT
Core's high-performance simulation capabilities.

The runtime can be utilized in two ways:

1. As a standalone library that can be linked to any QIR program, resulting in a
   binary executable.
2. By using the `mqt-core-qir-runner` command-line tool, which interprets QIR
   programs directly.

See {cite:p}`stadeTowardsSupportingQIR2025` for more details.

### Building the Runner

The runner is part of every MQT Core build. From the root of the repository, you
can build it as follows:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --target mqt-core-qir-runner
```

After building, the tool can be found in the build directory under
`bin/mqt-core-qir-runner`.

### Executing a QIR Program

The `mqt-core-qir-runner` can be used to execute a QIR file (typically with a
`.ll` extension).

```bash
./build/bin/mqt-core-qir-runner bell.ll
```

The entry-point function may have any valid LLVM name. If a module contains more
than one function with the `entry_point` attribute, select one explicitly. The
runner also supports repeated, reproducible execution:

```bash
./build/bin/mqt-core-qir-runner \
  --entry-point=bell_entry --shots=1024 --seed=7 bell.ll
```

### Executing Generated QIR from Python

The [QIR-Runner](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-runner) project provides
the `qir-runner` command-line executable and the `qirrunner` Python package. The
Python package can execute statically allocated Base Profile bitcode without an
intermediate file. Install it with `uv pip install qirrunner`, then pass the
result of {py:meth}`~mqt.core.mlir.QIRProgram.to_bitcode` to `run_bytes`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from qirrunner import OutputHandler, run_bytes

from mqt.core.mlir import OutputFormat, compile_program

bell_qasm = """OPENQASM 3.0;
include "stdgates.inc";
qubit[2] q;
h q[0];
ctrl @ x q[0], q[1];
bit[2] c = measure q;
"""

qir = compile_program(bell_qasm, output=OutputFormat.QIR_BASE)
output = OutputHandler()
run_bytes(qir.to_bitcode(), shots=4, rng_seed=7, output_fn=output.handle)

# Display the records produced for the first shot.
print(output.get_output().split("END", maxsplit=1)[0] + "END")
```

This path is tested for Base Profile programs with static qubit and result
allocation, including dedicated one- and two-control QIS functions and the
generic QIR controlled specialization used for three or more controls.
QIR-Runner does not currently implement every QIR 2.1 dynamic resource
management function supported by the MQT runner and DDSIM QDMI device; use those
MQT runtimes for dynamically allocated programs.

QIR entry points take no arguments and return an `i64` exit code. Runtime and
QIS declarations are checked before JIT compilation; a mismatched or unsupported
declaration is reported with its actual and accepted LLVM function types.

MQT Core implements the QIR 2.1 Base and Adaptive Profile runtime APIs. The JIT
accepts one exact LLVM type for each runtime declaration, so unsupported or
outdated overloads fail before execution.

MQT Core provides dedicated QIS functions for variants with one or two control
qubits, using the `c<gate>` and `cc<gate>` names. Operations with three or more
controls use generic `__ctl` and `__ctladj` specializations. The control qubits
are passed in an Array; parameterized and multi-target gates pass their original
arguments in a Tuple, following the QIR-Runner calling convention. MQT accepts
these functions as implementation-specific extensions to the QIR 2.1 Base and
Adaptive profiles, so the entry point keeps its `base_profile` or
`adaptive_profile` attribute.

MQT's two-angle phased-X rotation gate uses the `prx` QIS stem. The incompatible
QIR-Runner Pauli-axis operation named `r` is not part of MQT's QIS.

The runner prints the program's outputs to the console in one of the two
[QIR Output Schemas][output-schemas] (Labeled or Ordered): the two `HEADER`
records announce the schema, and each shot is wrapped in `START` and `END`
records with a `METADATA\toutput_labeling_schema\t<schema>` line inside.

The active schema is selected by the `output_labeling_schema` function attribute
on the entry-point function of the QIR program. The value `ordered` selects
Ordered; anything else, or a missing attribute, selects Labeled.

### QIR Support in the DDSIM QDMI Device

The QDMI Device accepts jobs in the following program formats: QASM2, QASM3, QIR
Base/Adaptive Profile Module (LLVM bitcode), and QIR Base/Adaptive Profile
String (LLVM assembly).

QDMI C++ applications submit textual programs through the
`Device::submitJob(const std::string&, ...)` overload, which includes the
terminating null byte required by QDMI. Binary module payloads use the
`Device::submitJob(std::span<const std::byte>, ...)` overload instead. It
preserves embedded null bytes and submits exactly the span's size without
appending a terminator. `Job::getProgramBytes()` retrieves such a payload
without interpreting its format or removing terminal null bytes; the existing
`Job::getProgram()` remains the textual, null-terminated accessor. It rejects
known binary and non-text formats based on their QDMI format identifier, even if
their payload happens to end in a null byte.

The Python API follows the same distinction: pass `str` to `Device.submit_job`
for a textual program and `bytes` for an exact binary payload.
`Job.program_bytes` always returns the unmodified payload, while `Job.program`
expects a null-terminated UTF-8 text payload and rejects known binary or
non-text formats.

Every DDSIM QIR job owns its JIT session, runtime, simulator state,
random-number generator, and output sink. QIR jobs can therefore execute
concurrently without sharing measurements or interleaving runtime output.
Sampling supports Base and Adaptive formats. Statevector extraction is limited
to Base formats: the JIT stops the selected entry point immediately before the
first call to a function marked `irreversible`, following the semantic boundary
defined by the Base Profile. It rejects other profiles and Base Profile programs
whose irreversible region is not terminal.
