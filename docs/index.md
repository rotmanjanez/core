# MQT Core - The Backbone of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

MQT Core is an open-source C++20 and Python library for quantum computing that
forms the backbone of the quantum software tools developed as part of the
_{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_. To this end, MQT Core
consists of multiple components that are used throughout the MQT, including a
fully fledged intermediate representation (IR) for quantum computations, a
state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) package for quantum computing, and a QIR
runtime based on the decision diagram package.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the MQT Core library,
including {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`, a
{doc}`quickstart guide for the MQT Core IR <mqt_core_ir>`, its
{doc}`decision diagram (DD) package <dd_package>`, as well as detailed
{doc}`API documentation <api/mqt/core/index>` and the
<a href="cpp/index.html">C++ API reference</a>. The source code of MQT Core is
publicly available on GitHub at
[munich-quantum-toolkit/core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core),
while pre-built binaries are available via
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core/) for all major operating systems and
all modern Python versions. MQT Core is fully compatible with Qiskit 1.0 and
above.

## Contributors and Supporters

MQT Core is developed by the
[Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and [MQSC](https://mq.sc).
Among others, it is part of the
[Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss)
ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the
[Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.
