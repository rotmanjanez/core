# Upgrade Guide

This document describes breaking changes and how to upgrade. For a complete list
of changes including minor and patch releases, please refer to the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### QDMI 1.4 program formats and results

MQT Core now requires QDMI 1.4. `ProgramFormat` is an immutable value with
`format_id`, `version`, `profile`, and `encoding` fields. Replace the old enum
members with exact descriptors. The standard descriptors include `OPENQASM2`,
`OPENQASM3`, `QIR21_BASE_TEXT`, `QIR21_BASE_BINARY`, `QIR21_ADAPTIVE_TEXT`, and
`QIR21_ADAPTIVE_BINARY`.

QDMI 1.4 removes the calibration pseudo-format. MQT Core therefore removes
`submit_calibration_job` and its C++ equivalent. The `needs_calibration` and
`getNeedsCalibration` device-state queries remain available. Device
implementations can advertise a vendor-defined calibration payload descriptor
when calibration is a program contract.

Use `submit_programs` or `Device::submitPrograms` to submit an ordered list in
one job. `Job.programs_num` reports the list size. All result methods accept an
optional program index, and `get_results(index, result)` returns an
uninterpreted `bytes` value. `get_program_output` now also returns exact
`bytes`; it no longer assumes text or removes a final byte.

### Removal of CoreAlgorithms

MQT Core no longer installs `MQT::CoreAlgorithms` or the headers below
`algorithms/`. MQT Core provides no direct replacement for the removed circuit
factories. Move required implementations to the package that uses them. The
`BUILD_MQT_CORE_BENCHMARKS` option and its legacy DD evaluation target were also
removed.

### Python 3.11 and split-mode wheels

MQT Core now requires Python 3.11 or newer. Upgrade the Python environment
before installing this release.

MQT Core now uses nanobind 3 split mode. One `cp311-abi3` wheel supports
GIL-enabled CPython 3.11 and newer. Free-threaded support starts with CPython
3.15 and uses a separate `cp315-abi3t` wheel. MQT Core no longer publishes
free-threaded CPython 3.13 or 3.14 wheels.

nanobind 3 changes the nanobind ABI. Rebuild downstream native Python extensions
that use MQT Core's nanobind-bound C++ types. Pure Python consumers do not need
to recompile anything.

The Python bindings depend on `nanobind-backend`, which supplies the
interpreter-specific nanobind runtime. This dependency does not change the C++
API or the Python import paths.

### Program serialization for QDMI Qiskit backends

`QDMIBackend` now serializes only the exact OpenQASM 3 and OpenQASM 2 formats.
The backend tries supported formats in the order reported by the device. MQT
Core no longer provides a global serializer registry or loads serializers from
the `mqt.core.qiskit.program_serializers` entry point group.

A package that owns a vendor format must also own the backend that serializes
and decodes it. Override the two protected hooks:

```python
class MyBackend(QDMIBackend):
    def _program_serializer(self, program_format):
        if program_format == IQM_JSON:
            return qiskit_to_iqm_json
        return super()._program_serializer(program_format)

    def _decode_counts(self, job):
        if self.payload_descriptor == IQM_JSON:
            return decode_iqm_counts(job)
        return super()._decode_counts(job)
```

A serializer takes the circuit and the backend. It returns `str` for a text
format and `bytes` for a binary format. The backend checks the returned type
against the exact format.

A backend subclass that must represent a device-native operation outside
Qiskit's standard gate library sets `_EXTRA_GATES`:

```python
class MyBackend(QDMIBackend):
    _EXTRA_GATES = {"move": MoveGate()}
```

MQT Core no longer provides `qiskit_to_iqm_json` or `MoveGate`.
[QDMI-on-IQM](https://github.com/iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM) owns both. Import them
from `iqm.qdmi` instead:

```python
from iqm.qdmi.serializers import qiskit_to_iqm_json
from iqm.qdmi.gates import MoveGate
```

Use the `IQMBackend` from `iqm-qdmi` to submit IQM JSON and decode IQM results.

### Removal of DD approximation and density-matrix support

MQT Core no longer provides the decision-diagram approximation algorithm. The
algorithm had no production owner in the MQT ecosystem. Remove uses of the
`dd/Approximation.hpp` header, the `dd::ApproximationMetadata` type, and the
`dd::approximate` function. MQT Core does not provide a replacement.

MQT Core also no longer provides density-matrix decision diagrams or the noise
operations that depended on them. Consumers must provide this functionality or
use another implementation.

### Private `nlohmann_json` dependency

MQT Core uses `nlohmann_json` only inside its implementation. It no longer
installs the library, exports it, or looks for it in its package configuration.
Depend on `nlohmann_json` directly if your project uses it.

No installed header includes a `nlohmann` header any more. The decision-diagram
statistics report through strings and streams instead. MQT Core removed the
following names:

- `dd::Statistics::json`, `dd::MemoryManagerStatistics::json`,
  `dd::TableStatistics::json`, and `dd::UniqueTableStatistics::json`. Use
  `toString`, the stream operator, or the individual counters.
- `dd::UniqueTable::getStatsJson`. Use `dd::getStatisticsString`.
- `dd::getStatistics` and `dd::getDataStructureStatistics`. Use
  `dd::getStatisticsString` and `dd::getDataStructureStatisticsString`, which
  return the same report as a JSON-formatted string.
- The `MQT_CORE_JSON_INSTALL` CMake option.

`dd::getStatisticsString` takes the `includeIndividualTables` flag that
`dd::getStatistics` used to take.

### Removal of the neutral-atom stack

MQT Core no longer contains any neutral-atom functionality. The complete stack
moved to [MQT QMAP](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap), which is
now its sole owner. Depend on MQT QMAP to keep using it.

MQT Core removed the following names:

- The `MQT::CoreNA`, `MQT::CoreNAQDMI`, `MQT::CoreQDMINaDevice`, and
  `MQT::CoreQDMINaDeviceConfig` CMake targets.
- The `BUILD_MQT_CORE_QDMI_NA_DEVICE` CMake option.
- The `na/NAComputation.hpp`, `na/entities/*.hpp`, `na/operations/*.hpp`,
  `na/qdmi/Device.hpp`, `qdmi/devices/na/Configuration.hpp`, and
  `ir/operations/AodOperation.hpp` headers.
- The `na` C++ namespace.
- The `mqt.core.na` Python module and its `mqt.core.na.qdmi` submodule.
- The `Move`, `Bridge`, `AodActivate`, `AodDeactivate`, and `AodMove`
  `qc::OpType` values, together with `QuantumComputation::move`,
  `QuantumComputation::bridge`, and the OpenQASM names `move`, `bridge`,
  `aod_activate`, `aod_deactivate`, and `aod_move`.
- The bundled `mqt.na.default` QDMI device.

### Removal of FoMaC compatibility APIs

MQT Core 4 removes the deprecated FoMaC names that MQT Core 3.9 kept as
compatibility aliases. Replace Python imports of QDMI entities from
`mqt.core.fomac` with imports from `mqt.core.qdmi`. Import registry functions
and `DeviceDefinition` from `mqt.core.qdmi.driver`.

MQT Core 4 also removes `mqt.core.qdmi.driver.Session`. Use
`registered_device_ids()` to discover devices and `open_device()` to open a
fresh device session. Pass provider configuration overrides to `open_device()`
when a device needs per-open configuration.

Apply these replacements to C++ and MLIR code:

- `fomac::` becomes `qdmi::`.
- `fomac/FoMaC.hpp` becomes `qdmi/Client.hpp`.
- `fomac/Slurm.hpp` becomes `qdmi/Slurm.hpp`.
- `MQT::CoreFoMaC` becomes `MQT::CoreQDMI`.
- `mlir/Compiler/FoMaCAdapter.h` and `MQTCompilerFoMaCAdapter` become
  `mlir/Compiler/QDMIAdapter.h` and `MQTCompilerQDMIAdapter`.

The class and function names do not change. For example:

```cpp
#include "qdmi/Client.hpp"

auto device = qdmi::Session::openDevice("mqt.ddsim.default");
```

### CoreIR API cleanup

The CoreIR API cleanup requires the following migrations:

- Replace `getNmeasuredQubits()` and `num_measured_qubits` with
  `getNoutputQubits()` and `num_output_qubits`, respectively.
- Replace permutation-aware `Operation::equals()` and `getUsedQubitsPermuted()`
  calls by applying the permutation to cloned operations before comparing them.
- Replace `getHighestLogicalQubitIndex()`, `printStatistics()`, and
  `printPermutation()` with `initialLayout.maxValue()`, the individual count
  accessors, and direct `Permutation` iteration, respectively.
- Construct output-permutation measurements explicitly instead of calling
  `appendMeasurementsAccordingToOutputPermutation()`.

The register lookup helpers `getQubitRegister()`, `getPhysicalQubitIndex()`, and
`physicalQubitIsAncillary()` are now private implementation details.

`QuantumComputation` no longer stores a random-number generator or seed. Remove
the third `seed` argument from C++ and Python constructor calls. C++ callers
that used `QuantumComputation::getGenerator()` must create and own a
random-number generator instead. Randomized circuit generators continue to
accept a seed and now own a separate generator for each call.

### Removal of the legacy circuit-to-MLIR translator

The compiler no longer accepts `qc::QuantumComputation` or
`mqt.core.ir.QuantumComputation` objects. The
`mlir::QCProgram::fromQuantumComputation` and Python
`QCProgram.from_quantum_computation` functions have been removed. Pass OpenQASM,
a Qiskit circuit, or a typed MLIR program to the compiler instead. Existing
Python code can convert a legacy circuit to OpenQASM 3 before compilation:

```python
program = compile_program(computation.qasm3_str())
```

### Removal of the ZX-calculus library

MQT Core no longer provides the `mqt-core-zx` library, the `MQT::CoreZX` CMake
target, the `mqt-core/zx` headers, or the global `zx` namespace. Remove these
from downstream includes and link dependencies. Equivalence-checking users
should use [MQT QCEC]; QCEC's ZX implementation is internal and is not a
replacement public API.

The `MQT::Multiprecision` target and the `USE_SYSTEM_BOOST`,
`MQT_CORE_WITH_GMP`, and `MQT_CORE_ZX_SYSTEM_BOOST` CMake options have also been
removed. MQT Core no longer discovers, fetches, or exports configuration for
Boost.Multiprecision or GMP.

### QIR execution

The standalone QIR runner now invokes a selected QIR entry point as a
parameterless `i64` function instead of assuming an `int main(int, char**)`. Use
`--entry-point` to select among multiple entry points, `--shots` for repeated
execution, and `--seed` for deterministic sampling.

Dynamic QIR inputs must use the current QIR 2.1 resource-management interface.
Legacy qir-runner allocator and output overloads are no longer accepted.

The DDSIM QDMI device now isolates the runtime, simulator state, random-number
generator, and output sink of every QIR job. Concurrently submitted jobs no
longer share execution state or write QIR records to process stdout.

QIR statevector extraction is supported only for Base-format jobs. The input
must mark its first measurement boundary as `irreversible`, and no quantum work
may follow that boundary. Adaptive-format statevector requests continue to
return `QDMI_ERROR_NOTSUPPORTED`.

### LLVM/MLIR required for all source builds

MQT Core now builds its MLIR-based compiler infrastructure unconditionally. LLVM
22.1+ (including MLIR) is therefore required when building MQT Core from source,
including as a CMake dependency or Python package. The `BUILD_MQT_CORE_MLIR`
CMake option has been removed. The QIR runner and QIR support in the DDSIM QDMI
Device are also built unconditionally, so the `BUILD_MQT_CORE_QIR_RUNNER` and
`BUILD_MQT_CORE_QDMI_DDSIM_WITH_QIR` options have been removed. Remove these
three options from build scripts and presets.

We offer pre-built distributions for all supported platforms as part of the
`setup-mlir` project at
[munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir](https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir).
Please follow the instructions there to install the distribution for your
platform. You can then point CMake to the installation directory using the
`-DMLIR_DIR=/path/to/mlir/installation/lib/cmake/mlir` option.

For local development, you can configure `MLIR_DIR` once in a repository-local
`.env` file (for example, `MLIR_DIR=/path/to/installation/lib/cmake/mlir`). MQT
Core's CMake setup will pick this up automatically when `MLIR_DIR` is not
otherwise provided.

Known limitations:

- Our pre-built distributions are incompatible with GCC on macOS. Use
  (Apple)Clang instead or compile LLVM from source using your preferred
  compiler.
- AppleClang 17+ is required to build MQT Core due to some C++20 features that
  are not yet properly supported by older versions.

### Removal of the `datastructures` (sub)library

MQT Core no longer provides the `datastructures` (`ds`) sublibrary. MQT QMAP was
its only consumer. Downstream users must depend on MQT QMAP or provide the
required data structures directly.

## [3.9.1]

### Program serializers for the Qiskit backend

The Qiskit backend no longer decides in its own code how to turn a circuit into
a program. It takes every program format from a registered _program serializer_,
and MQT Core registers its own OpenQASM 2 and OpenQASM 3 serializers the same
way as everyone else.

A serializer takes the circuit and the backend. It returns `str` for a text
format and `bytes` for a binary format;
{py:func}`~mqt.core.qdmi.is_binary_program_format` states which kind a format
carries. Register one at run time:

```python
import io

from qiskit import qpy

from mqt.core.plugins.qiskit import register_program_serializer
from mqt.core.qdmi import ProgramFormat


def my_qpy_serializer(circuit, backend) -> bytes:
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    qpy.dump(circuit, buffer)
    return buffer.getvalue()


register_program_serializer(ProgramFormat.QPY, my_qpy_serializer)
```

A package that owns a device advertises its serializer through the
`mqt.core.qiskit.program_serializers` entry point group instead, so MQT Core
finds it without importing the package:

```toml
[project.entry-points."mqt.core.qiskit.program_serializers"]
IQM_JSON = "iqm.qdmi.serializers:qiskit_to_iqm_json"
```

`mqt.core.plugins.qiskit.serializers.PROGRAM_FORMAT_PREFERENCE` states which
format the backend picks when a device accepts several. Pass `replace=True` to
`register_program_serializer` to take over a format that already has a
serializer, including OpenQASM 2 and OpenQASM 3.

A backend subclass that must represent a device-native operation outside
Qiskit's standard gate library sets `_EXTRA_GATES`:

```python
class MyBackend(QDMIBackend):
    _EXTRA_GATES = {"move": MoveGate()}
```

### IQM JSON serialization moved to QDMI-on-IQM

MQT Core no longer provides `qiskit_to_iqm_json` or `MoveGate`.
[QDMI-on-IQM](https://github.com/iqm-finland/QDMI-on-IQM) owns both. Import them
from `iqm.qdmi` instead:

```python
from iqm.qdmi.serializers import qiskit_to_iqm_json
from iqm.qdmi.gates import MoveGate
```

Installing `iqm-qdmi` is enough to keep submitting IQM JSON. The package
advertises its serializer through the entry point group described above, so a
backend over an IQM device needs no code change.

## [3.9.0]

### Shared-library ABI version

The shared-library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) changes from `3.8` to `3.9`.
Rebuild downstream C++ libraries against MQT Core 3.9.0. In `cibuildwheel`
configurations that exclude bundled MQT Core libraries from wheel repair,
replace each `libmqt-core-*.so.3.8` entry with the corresponding
`libmqt-core-*.so.3.9` entry.

### `nanobind` updated to version 2.15.0

`nanobind` 2.15.0 changes the `nanobind` ABI. Rebuild downstream native Python
extensions that use MQT Core's `nanobind`-bound C++ types. Pure Python consumers
do not need to recompile anything.

### QDMI updated to version 1.3.3

The minimum supported QDMI version changes from 1.3.2 to 1.3.3. CMake builds
that use a system installation of QDMI must provide version 1.3.3 or newer.
Builds that let MQT Core fetch QDMI need no change.

### QDMI calibration runs and batch jobs

`Device::submitJob` used to reject `CALIBRATION` and `BATCH_JOB` together, which
left MQT Core reporting that a device needs calibration through
`needs_calibration()` without any way to trigger one. The two formats are
different cases and are now treated as such.

A calibration run has its own entry point. QDMI does not require a program for
one, so the payload is optional; when it is present, the device defines what it
means:

```python
device.submit_calibration_job()
device.submit_calibration_job("configuration")
```

In C++, use `Device::submitCalibrationJob`. A calibration run executes no
circuit, so neither form takes a shot count.

Batch jobs are explicitly unsupported. A batch job's program is a list of job
handles rather than a byte payload, which `submitJob` cannot express. Passing
`ProgramFormat.BATCH_JOB` to `submit_job` raises `ValueError` in Python and
`std::invalid_argument` in C++.

### Removal of QDMI configuration through `pyproject.toml`

MQT Core no longer reads QDMI device definitions from a `[tool.qdmi]` table in
`pyproject.toml`. Project discovery now looks only for `qdmi.json`. Move an
existing table into a `qdmi.json` file beside the `pyproject.toml`. For example,
replace this `pyproject.toml` table:

```toml
[tool.qdmi]
devices = [
  { id = "example.device", library = "libexample-device.so", prefix = "EXAMPLE" },
]
```

with this `qdmi.json`:

```json
{
  "schema-version": 1,
  "qdmi": {
    "devices": [
      {
        "id": "example.device",
        "library": "libexample-device.so",
        "prefix": "EXAMPLE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The JSON document adds the `"schema-version": 1` key and nests the device array
under `qdmi`. Every other key keeps its name and meaning. Relative paths still
resolve against the file that declares them. `MQT_CORE_QDMI_CONFIG_FILE`,
`MQT_CORE_QDMI_CONFIG_JSON`, the system and user files, and the packaged
`*.qdmi.json` fragments do not change.

### QDMI Qiskit primitive options

`QDMISampler` and `QDMIEstimator` no longer accept the MQT-specific `options`
mapping. Pass shot and precision defaults directly, preferably through the
backend factories:

```python
sampler = backend.sampler(default_shots=2048)
estimator = backend.estimator(default_precision=0.01, default_shots=2048)
```

Replace `QDMIEstimator(..., options={"default_shots": shots})` with
`QDMIEstimator(..., default_shots=shots)`. The sampler ignored its former
`options` mapping, so remove that argument without replacement.

### Runtime-configurable SC QDMI device

The built-in superconducting QDMI provider now parses its device description
when each session is initialized. The `mqt-core-qdmi-sc-device-gen` target,
SC-specific generator executable, `sc::writeHeader`, `sc::writeJSONSchema`, and
generated `DeviceMemberInitializers.hpp` file have been removed. Replace
generator API use with `sc::Device` and the `sc::readJSON` functions declared in
`qdmi/devices/sc/Configuration.hpp`.

### Runtime-configurable neutral-atom QDMI device

The built-in neutral-atom QDMI provider now parses its device description when
each session is initialized. The `mqt-core-qdmi-na-device-gen` target,
`mqt-core-qdmi-na-device-generator` executable, `na::writeHeader`, and generated
`DeviceMemberInitializers.hpp` file have been removed. Replace generator API use
with the `na::Device` configuration type and the `na::readJSON` functions in
`qdmi/devices/na/Configuration.hpp`.

At runtime, use the registry `session.device-config` field or Python
`device_config` and `device_config_file` arguments. Direct low-level QDMI
clients pass inline JSON through CUSTOM1 or a file path through CUSTOM2.

### QDMI Python namespace

The native Python module has moved from `mqt.core.fomac` to `mqt.core.qdmi`.
QDMI entities such as `Device`, `Job`, and `ProgramFormat` are in
`mqt.core.qdmi`. Import functions and classes from `mqt.core.qdmi.driver` for
device discovery, registration, and opening:

```python
from mqt.core.qdmi.driver import open_device

device = open_device("mqt.ddsim.default")
```

`mqt.core.fomac` remains available in MQT Core v3 and re-exports the same
objects. Importing that module emits a `DeprecationWarning`. It will be removed
in MQT Core 4.0. The legacy `driver.Session` class also emits a
`DeprecationWarning` when constructed and will be removed in 4.0. Replace
session-based discovery with `registered_device_ids()` and `open_device()` from
`mqt.core.qdmi.driver`.

The neutral-atom specialization has moved from `mqt.core.na.fomac` to
`mqt.core.na.qdmi`. The former submodule remains a v3 compatibility alias and
will be removed in MQT Core 4.0.

The C++ FoMaC namespace, headers, library, and `MQT::CoreFoMaC` target do not
change.

### Python binding CMake helper

The `add_mqt_python_binding_nanobind` function is now called
`add_mqt_python_binding`. Rename the calls in downstream `CMakeLists.txt` files:

```cmake
add_mqt_python_binding(
  MYPACKAGE
  py_mypackage
  ${SOURCES}
  MODULE_NAME
  _core
  INSTALL_DIR
  .
  LINK_LIBS
  MQT::Core)
```

The old `add_mqt_python_binding` function built modules with `pybind11` and has
been removed. MQT Core now uses that name for its `nanobind` helper. The
arguments to the renamed helper do not change.

## [3.8.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.7` to `3.8`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### QDMI updated to version 1.3.2

MQT Core already bundled QDMI 1.3.2 in the previous release, but now also
requires at least that version when using a system-provided QDMI installation.

### Bundled QDMI devices in embedded builds

The bundled QDMI devices now have individual CMake options:
`BUILD_MQT_CORE_QDMI_DDSIM_DEVICE`, `BUILD_MQT_CORE_QDMI_NA_DEVICE`, and
`BUILD_MQT_CORE_QDMI_SC_DEVICE`. All three remain enabled by default in a
standalone MQT Core build. They default to disabled when MQT Core is consumed
through CMake's `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory`; embedded consumers can
enable only the devices they need before making MQT Core available. The QDMI
driver and FoMaC libraries remain available independently.

### QDMI runtime device registration

The unstable runtime-loading helpers have been replaced with registration by a
stable device ID followed by an explicit open. In Python, replace
`add_dynamic_device_library(library_path, prefix, ...)` with:

```python
from mqt.core.fomac import DeviceDefinition, open_device, register_device

definition = DeviceDefinition("my.device", library_path, prefix, base_url="https://device.example")
register_device(definition)
device = open_device("my.device")
```

Per-backend session values can be passed directly to
`open_device("my.device", base_url=..., token=...)`. Every call creates a fresh
device session without registering another device ID. Repeated integration setup
can use `register_device_if_absent(definition)` instead of suppressing
duplicate-ID errors; invalid definitions are still rejected, and a device
disabled by higher-precedence configuration remains reserved.

The equivalent C++ flow is:

```cpp
qdmi::DeviceDefinition definition{.id = "my.device",
                                  .library = libraryPath,
                                  .prefix = prefix};
auto& driver = qdmi::Driver::get();
driver.registerDevice(definition);
auto device = fomac::Session::openDevice("my.device");
```

Registration validates and stores metadata without loading native code. Opening
an unknown or disabled ID fails. `fomac::Session::openDevice` creates a fresh
owned session on every call. `qdmi::Driver::open(id)` retains its cached-device
behavior for client callers.

See the {doc}`QDMI device configuration guide <qdmi/configuration>` for the
versioned JSON and TOML formats, configuration precedence, and relocatable
device manifests.

### FoMaC program payload handling

FoMaC now distinguishes textual programs from exact binary payloads. In C++, use
`Device::submitJob(const std::string&, ...)` for text formats and
`Device::submitJob(std::span<const std::byte>, ...)` for binary formats. In
Python, pass `str` for text and `bytes` for binary payloads. In particular, QIR
`*_STRING` formats are text, while QIR `*_MODULE` formats are LLVM bitcode and
must be submitted as bytes.

`Job::getProgram()` and Python's `Job.program` remain the textual accessors and
now reject binary or non-null-terminated payloads. Use `Job::getProgramBytes()`
or `Job.program_bytes` to retrieve the exact submitted bytes. Calibration and
batch-job formats cannot be submitted through these generic program APIs because
their QDMI payloads have specialized representations.

### QDMI child devices

The QDMI driver now translates device-library-specific `QDMI_Child_Device`
handles into client-facing `QDMI_Device` handles backed by dedicated child
sessions. Direct child devices can be queried through
`fomac::Device::getChildDevices()` in C++ and `Device.child_devices()` in
Python. Devices without child-device support continue to behave unchanged.

## [3.7.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.6` to `3.7`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### `nanobind` updated to version 2.13.0

This release updates the `nanobind` dependency to version 2.13.0, which includes
an ABI bump. Any existing code that uses the `mqt-core` Python bindings will
need to be recompiled with the new `nanobind` version.

### QDMI updated to version 1.3.2

While not a breaking change, this release updates the QDMI dependency to version
1.3.2

### CMake presets

[CMake presets] have been added to provide a standardized and reproducible way
to configure builds across different platforms. These presets are also used in
our CI. They assume that `MLIR_DIR` is defined in your environment and pointing
to an MLIR installation.

On Unix systems, the `debug`, `release`, and `coverage` presets can be used to
configure, build, and test MQT Core.

```console
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
```

Additionally, the `lint` preset can be used to configure and build MQT Core in
preparation for a `clang-tidy` run.

If you are on Windows, use the `debug-windows` and `release-windows` presets.

## [3.6.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.5` to `3.6`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### Changes to builtin QDMI devices

The builtin QDMI devices (with prefixes `MQT_SC`, `MQT_NA`, and `MQT_DDSIM`) are
now all built as shared libraries by default. In turn, the shared library
wrappers (with prefixes `MQT_SC_DYN` and `MQT_NA_DYN`) have been removed
entirely. MQT Core's QDMI driver will automatically load the shared libraries of
the builtin devices if they are available in the library search path. If you
were previously using the statically builtin devices, no changes should be
necessary as the shared libraries are now the default. If you were previously
using the shared library wrappers, you should switch to using the builtin
devices instead, which are now shared libraries by default.

### Broader operation support in QDMI Qiskit converter

The QDMI Qiskit converter now supports a broader range of operations, including
multi-controlled gates such as `mcx`, `mcz`, `mcrx`, and more. As a consequence,
these operations can now be directly used without requiring decomposition, for
example, with the builtin `DDSIM` QDMI device.

### Minimum supported Qiskit version

From this release onwards, MQT Core requires Qiskit version 1.1.0 or higher.
This is due to the fact that we are relying on some fixes to Qiskit primitives
that were introduced in that version. If you are using MQT Core with Qiskit,
please ensure that you have updated to Qiskit 1.1.0 or higher to avoid any
compatibility issues.

## [3.5.1]

No breaking changes.

### Component-based CMake installs

Fixed exported `nlohmann_json` CMake metadata so `find_package(mqt-core CONFIG)`
no longer propagates an invalid `.../COMPONENT` include directory in
component-based installations. Anyone relying on an installed version of
`mqt-core` should update from 3.5.0 to 3.5.1.

## [3.5.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.4` to `3.5`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### `nanobind` updated to version 2.12.0

This release updates the `nanobind` dependency to version 2.12.0, which includes
an ABI bump. Any existing code that uses the `mqt-core` Python bindings will
need to be recompiled with the new `nanobind` version.

## [3.4.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.3` to `3.4`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### Python wheels

This release contains two changes to the distributed wheels.

First, we have removed all wheels for Python 3.13t. Free-threading Python was
introduced as an experimental feature in Python 3.13. It became stable in Python
3.14.

Second, for Python 3.12+, we are now providing Stable ABI wheels instead of
separate version-specific wheels. This was enabled by migrating our Python
bindings from `pybind11` to `nanobind`.

Both of these changes were made in the interest of conserving PyPI space and
reducing CI/CD build times. The full list of wheels now reads:

- 3.10
- 3.11
- 3.12+ Stable ABI
- 3.14t

### QDMI-Qiskit integration

This release introduces a Qiskit `BackendV2`-compatible interface to QDMI
devices. The `mqt.core.plugins.qiskit` module has been extended with
`QDMIProvider`, `QDMIBackend`, and `QDMIJob` classes that allow running Qiskit
circuits on QDMI-compliant devices.

Users can now execute Qiskit circuits directly on QDMI devices:

```python
from mqt.core.plugins.qiskit import QDMIProvider

provider = QDMIProvider()
backend = provider.get_backend("MQT Core DDSIM QDMI Device")
job = backend.run(circuit, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
```

The backend automatically converts circuits to QASM, introspects device
capabilities, validates circuits, and formats results. The existing FoMaC
interface (`mqt.core.fomac`) remains fully supported for direct, low-level
access to QDMI devices.

Install with Qiskit support: `uv pip install "mqt-core[qiskit]"`

See the
[Qiskit Backend documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/core/en/latest/qdmi/qdmi_backend.html)
for details.

### Argument name changes in `QuantumComputation` and `CompoundOperation` dunder methods

Since we enabled `ty` for type checking, it revealed that some of the dunder
methods of `QuantumComputation` and `CompoundOperation` had incorrect argument
names, which would prevent these classes from properly implementing the
`MutableSequence` protocol. This release fixes these issues by renaming the
arguments of the following methods:

- `QuantumComputation.__getitem__`
- `QuantumComputation.__setitem__`
- `QuantumComputation.__delitem__`
- `QuantumComputation.insert`
- `QuantumComputation.append`
- `CompoundOperation.__getitem__`
- `CompoundOperation.__setitem__`
- `CompoundOperation.__delitem__`
- `CompoundOperation.insert`
- `CompoundOperation.append`

All index arguments are now named `index` instead of `idx` (or `i` or `slice`)
and all values are now named `value` instead of `val` (or `op` or `ops`).

### DD Package evaluation

This release moves the DD Package evaluation functionality from within the
`mqt.core` package to a dedicated script in the `eval` directory. In the
process, the `mqt-core-dd-compare` entry point as well as the `evaluation` extra
have been removed. The `eval/dd_evaluation.py` script acts as a drop-in
replacement for the previous CLI entry point. Since the `eval` directory is not
part of the Python package, this functionality is only available via source
installations or by cloning the repository.

## [3.3.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.2` to `3.3`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

### IfElseOperation

This release introduces an `IfElseOperation` to the C++ library and the Python
package to support Qiskit's `IfElseOp`. The new operation replaces the
`ClassicControlledOperation`.

An `IfElseOperation` can be added to a `QuantumComputation` using `if_else()`.

```python
qc.if_else(
    then_operation=StandardOperation(target=0, op_type=OpType.x),
    else_operation=StandardOperation(target=0, op_type=OpType.y),
    control_bit=0,
)
```

If no else operation is needed, the `if_()` method can be used.

```python
qc.if_(op_type=OpType.x, target=0, control_bit=0)
```

### End of support for Python 3.9

Starting with this release, MQT Core no longer supports Python 3.9. This is in
line with the scheduled end of life of the version. As a result, MQT Core is no
longer tested under Python 3.9 and no longer ships Python 3.9 wheels.

## [3.2.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.1` to `3.2`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

With this release, the minimum required C++ version has been raised from C++17
to C++20. The default compilers of our test systems support all relevant
features of the standard. Some frameworks we plan to integrate with even require
C++20 by now.

The `dd.BasisStates`, `ir.operations.ComparisonKind`,
`ir.operations.Control.Type`, and `ir.operations.OpType` enums are now exposed
via `pybind11`'s new `py::native_enum`, which makes them compatible with
Python's `enum.Enum` class (PEP 435). As a result, the enums can no longer be
initialized using a string. Instead of `OpType("x")`, use `OpType.x`.

## [3.1.0]

The shared library ABI version (`SOVERSION`) is increased from `3.0` to `3.1`.
Thus, consuming libraries need to update their wheel repair configuration for
`cibuildwheel` to ensure the `mqt-core` libraries are properly skipped in the
wheel repair step.

Even though this is not a breaking change, it is worth mentioning to developers
of MQT Core that all Python code (except tests) has been moved to the top-level
`python` directory. Furthermore, the C++ code for the Python bindings has been
moved to the top-level `bindings` directory.

### DD Package

The `makeZeroState`, `makeBasisState`, `makeGHZState`, `makeWState`, and
`makeStateFromVector` methods have been refactored to functions taking the DD
package as an argument. These functions reside in the `StateGeneration` header.
Any existing code that uses these methods must replace the respective calls with
their function counterpart.

## [3.0.0]

This major release introduces several breaking changes, including the removal of
deprecated features and the introduction of new APIs. In preparation for this
release, most direct dependents of MQT Core have been updated to use the new
APIs. The following sections describe the most important changes and how to
adapt your code accordingly. We intend to provide a more comprehensive migration
guide for future releases.

### Intermediate Representation (IR)

The OpenQASM parser has been encapsulated in its own library, which is now a
dedicated target in the CMake build system. Any use of
`qc::QuantumComputation::import...` needs to be replaced with the respective
`qasm3::Importer::load...` function.

Several parsers have been removed, including the `.real`, `.qc`, `.tfc`, and
`GRCS` parsers. The `.real` parser lives on as part of the [MQT SyReC] project.
All others have been removed without replacement.

The `Teleportation` gate has been removed from the IR. This was a placeholder
gate and was only used in a single method (in [MQT QMAP]), which is bound to be
removed as part of [MQT QMAP] `v3.0.0`.

[MQT QCEC], [MQT QMAP], and [MQT DDSIM] have been updated to use the new API,
which will be released in [MQT QCEC] `v3.0.0`, [MQT QMAP] `v3.0.0` and
[MQT DDSIM] `v2.0.0`.

### DD Package

The DD package has undergone some initial refactoring to streamline the
implementation and prepare it for future extensions. The `Config` template has
been removed in favor of a constructor that takes the configuration as a
parameter. Any existing code using `dd::Package<...>` needs to be updated to use
`dd::Package` or `dd::Package(numQubits, ...)` instead. The `MemoryManager` and
adjacent classes have been refactored to remove the template parameters. This
should not have user-visible effects, but it is a breaking change nonetheless.
Depending libraries may now also use the `mqt-core` Python package to interact
with the DD package.

[MQT QCEC] and [MQT DDSIM] have been updated to use the new API, which will be
released in [MQT QCEC] `v3.0.0` and [MQT DDSIM] `v2.0.0`.

### Neutral Atom Quantum Computing

The `NAComputation` class hierarchy has been refactored to use an MLIR-inspired
design. This will act as a foundation for future extensions and improvements.

[MQT QMAP] has been updated to use the new API, which will be released in
[MQT QMAP] `v3.0.0`.

### General

MQT Core has moved to the
[munich-quantum-toolkit](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit) GitHub
organization under <https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core>. While most
links should be automatically redirected, please update any links in your code
to point to the new location. All links in the documentation have been updated
accordingly.

MQT Core now ships all its C++ libraries as shared libraries with the `mqt-core`
Python package. Depending packages can now solely rely on the Python package for
obtaining the C++ libraries. This is demonstrated in [MQT QCEC] `v3.0.0`,
[MQT QMAP] `v3.0.0` and [MQT DDSIM] `v2.0.0`, which will be released in the near
future.

MQT Core now requires CMake 3.24 or higher. Most modern operating systems should
have this version available in their package manager. Alternatively, CMake can
be conveniently installed from PyPI using the
[`cmake`](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/) package.

It also requires the `uv` library version 0.5.20 or higher.
